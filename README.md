> The extension provides refactoring tools for your React/Javascript/Typescript codebase



[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix/vscode-glean.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wix/vscode-glean)

The extension provides refactoring tools for your React codebase: extract JSX into a new component, convert Function to Stateful React Components and more! In addition, you can extract regular Javascript/Typescript code between files, while handling exporting the selected code from the old location and importing in the new one!

## Highlights
- Allows extracing JSX into new component as well as other React code refactoring options
- Moving code between files
- Typescript support
- ES2015 modules support
- CommonJS modules support
- Plain Text support

### JSX Support
#### Extracting JSX into a new Component
Glean allows easy extraction of JSX into new React components. Just select the JSX to extract, and Glean will handle all the rest:

- Generate Stateful or Stateless Component, such that the extracted JSX will continue to function.
- It will identify all inputs to the newly created component.
- Replace extracted JSX will newly created component, while providing it with all the props.

## Configuration Options
#### glean.jsModuleSystem (Default: 'esm')
Determines how the selected code will be exported/imported. Valid options are 'esm' and 'commonjs'.

#### glean.jsFilesExtensions (Default: [ "js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx" ])

#### glean.switchToTarget (Default: false)
Determines whether VSCode should switch to target file after extracting.
